# [Knowledge is Power]()

Knowledge is Power is a app for users to view fundraiser focused on raising money to educate people around the world. 
The idea comes from the belief that teaching even basic skills is the key to getting people out of poverty and able to
support themselves as well as pass on knowledge.  Users can collaborate on raising awareness as fundraisers can be added,
edited and deleted by the users so everyone can get involved and help keep things up to date. The hope is by having a 
collection of education fundraisers in one place people are more likely to contribute to a few or help spread awareness 
on any they really resonate with them.

## Developer goals

-To create a app with Flask and MongoDB that has the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update and Delete to showcase skills 
learnt in the data centric development module of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) course I am taking. This app was created 
for the 3rd milestone project.

-To create an aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate app with clear feedback for users.

-To create a basic log in feature 

-To gain knowledge and improve on what I have learnt on the creation of a CRUD application from start to finish.

### Design


#### Color Scheme

The colours were chosen after looking at a range of websites of charities that focus on raising money for education. I found a 
warm orange is used a lot perhaps to create a sense or urgency and chose this as the main colour. For this colour to stand out
well it was best to keep a white background throughout. The blues and greens are also colours seen across the sites I looked at
on buttons and features.  They are friendly and green is good for an action buttons and making certain information stand out.

- ![#ff8500](https://placehold.it/15/ff8500/ff8500) `#ff8500` (**Orange** )
- ![#505050](https://placehold.it/15/505050/505050) `#505050` (**Dark Grey** )
- ![#03ADDF](https://placehold.it/15/03ADDF/03ADDF) `#03ADDF` (**Bright Blue** )
- ![#94c83d](https://placehold.it/15/94c83d/94c83d) `#94c83d` (**Bright Green** )

#### Typography

I used Oswald is the font for headers, it was a free font that is comparable to fonts I had seen on charity sites. It is clear 
and bold and works well with the theme of urgency and giving. Lato was used as the main text has a soft friendly feel to keep a 
chirpy feel to the details of what good will come from supporting the fundraisers.
