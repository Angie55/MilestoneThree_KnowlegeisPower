                with beneficiaries around the world. You can browse what has been added and also add a fundraiser you have seen and would like to raise awareness for. You can also make 
                updates to existing fundraisers such as how close they are to the target and any new inspiring information. We hope that by having a collection of fundraiser in one place
                it will encourage more donations across various fundraisers.

                <p class="home-text">Here at KIP we believe that education really is the key to improving lives around the world. Giving the gift of knowledge can give essential skills 
                that can empower an individual or community to work and provide for themselves and their families. No one should be denied an education and be forced to struggle or into 
                an unsafe way of life just to eat and have a roof over their head because they lack even basic skills such as reading, writing and maths.
